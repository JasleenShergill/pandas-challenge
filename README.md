Welcome to the PyCitySchools Analysis project! In this data exploration journey, we'll dive into the world of education to uncover fascinating insights about school performance and student achievement.

**Project Overview**
PyCitySchools Analysis is an exciting exploration of standardized test data and school metrics. By leveraging the power of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, we'll conduct in-depth analyses to understand district-wide trends, school performance, and factors influencing student success.

**Project Structure**

**District Summary:** High-level snapshot of key metrics across the entire district.  
**School Summary**: Detailed analysis of each school's performance and characteristics.  
**Top-Performing Schools:** Discover the top schools based on overall passing percentage.  
**Lowest-Performing Schools:** Identify schools with the lowest overall passing percentage.  
**Math and Reading Scores by Grade:** Explore average scores for each grade level at every school.  
**Scores by School Spending:** Analyze school performance based on spending ranges per student.  
**Scores by School Size:** Investigate how school size affects student performance.
